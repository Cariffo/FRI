-Interface Fa0/1 is connected to a PC. Fa0/2 is a trunk link to another switch. All other ports are unused. Which security best practice did the administrator forget to configure?
	All user ports are associated with VLANs distinct from VLAN 1 and distinct from the ‘black-hole’ VLAN.

-A Cisco switch currently allows traffic tagged with VLANs 10 and 20 across trunk port Fa0/5. What is the effect of issuing a switchport trunk allowed vlan 30 command on Fa0/5?
	It allows only VLAN 30 on Fa0/5.

-Refer to the exhibit. A frame is traveling between PC-A and PC-B through the switch. Which statement is true concerning VLAN tagging of the frame?
	No VLAN tag is added to the frame.

-What happens to a port that is associated with VLAN 10 when the administrator deletes VLAN 10 from the switch?
	The port becomes inactive.

-Which switch feature ensures that no unicast, multicast, or broadcast traffic is passed between ports that are configured with this feature?
	PVLAN protected port

-A network administrator is determining the best placement of VLAN trunk links. Which two types of point-to-point connections utilize VLAN trunking?? (Choose two.)
	between a switch and a server that has an 802.1Q NIC
	between two switches that utilize multiple VLANs

-In a basic VLAN hopping attack, which switch feature do attackers take advantage of?
	the default automatic trunking configuration

-Which two statements are true about VLAN implementation? (Choose two.)
	VLANs logically group hosts, regardless of physical location.
	Devices in one VLAN do not hear the broadcasts from devices in another VLAN.

-Which two Layer 2 security best practices would help prevent VLAN hopping attacks? (Choose two.)
	Change the native VLAN number to one that is distinct from all user VLANs and is not VLAN 1.
	Disable DTP autonegotiation on end-user ports.

-Under which two occasions should an administrator disable DTP while managing a local area network? (Choose two.)
	on links that should not be trunking
	when connecting a Cisco switch to a non-Cisco switch

ak zabranime pristup portu ku urcitej vlanke, port sa automaticky zaradi do defaultnej vlan (vlan 1). ale ak vymazeme celu vlan, potom sa porty, ktore do nej patrili, stanu vypnutymi
