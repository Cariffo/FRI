What is different between IPv6 routing table entries compared to IPv4 routing table entries?
	By design IPv6 is classless so all routes are effectively level 1 ultimate routes.

Refer to the exhibit. Based on the partial output from the show ip route command, what two facts can be determined about the RIP routing protocol? (Choose two.)

	RIP version 2 is running on this router and its RIP neighbor.
	The command no auto-summary has been used on the RIP neighbor router.

The command 	"version 2" is used in RIP router configuration mode to enable the sending of subnet masks with the routing updates.

Which route will a router use to forward an IPv4 packet after examining its routing table for the best match with the destination address?
	a level 1 ultimate route

When configuring RIPng, the 	"default-information originate"	 command instructs the router to propagate a static default route.

Which two requirements are used to determine if a route can be considered as an ultimate route in a router’s routing table? (Choose two.)
	contain a next-hop IP address
	contain an exit interface
