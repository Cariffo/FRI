1) download eve-ng iso image
2) put it on a usb with LiLi on windows (dd on linux does not work!)
3) boot from the usb
4) choose "Install Eve Bare"
install eve-ng as a normal ubuntu WITH A CABLE INTERNET CONNECTION (cable connected internet is not necesarry for installation 
of the operating system, but it is necesarry for the eve-ng packages after the ubuntu installation is finished and 
the computer is rebooted after the installation is complete)
When prompted, how the server should be updated, choose "No automatic updates".
As the installation is complete, the system reboots. During initial boot it will install required packages.
After all necessary packages are installed, the system will reboot again.
Log in as root / eve
After first login an initial configuration may be required. When not sure, leave it on defaults.

PROBLEM: eth0 interface has been not detected after ubuntu installation! "failed to raise network interface" "interface eth0 
doesn't exist"


Changing step 4) to "Install Eve VM"
same problem :/
